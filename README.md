**Phase 2 Specification**

Technology Project: Museum Website Analysis & Redesign
Phase 2 - Solution Design & Implementation

1. Purpose of Phase 2

The purpose of Phase 2 of the Technology Project is to translate a data-identified usability problem into a clear and functional front-end solution. Based on the dataset and project criteria, the core problem motivating this redesign is:

- Users struggle to find ticket-related information and the purchase funnel is longer or more confusing than necessary

Hence, Phase 2 focuses on designing and implementing a museum website that fulfills the following:

- Prioritizes key user objectives

- Reduces navigation depth and decision fatigue

- Makes the “Buy Tickets” action obvious, persistent, and low-friction

- Demonstrates clear alignment between problem -> design -> implementation

- Clarity, structure, and usability takes precedence over visual polishing

2. Primary User Objectives

The redesigned website is organized around the following user objectives:

A. Sell tickets: Users should be able to easily locate ticket information and move into checkout with minimal friction.

B. Provide logistical information: Users should quickly be able to find hours, location, and transportation details to plan a visit.

C. Provide information about the exhibition(s): Users should understand what is on display and why it is worth visiting.

D. Provide information about the artist: Users should be able to learn contextual background without disrupting task flow.

E. Reduce friction and decision fatigue: This supports the objective of Phase 2, specifically, the site should minimize unnecessary navigation, redundant content, and unclear pathways, especially during ticket purchase and visit planning.

3. Information Architecture Options Considered

Before implementing the site, multiple information architecture (aka IA) approaches were considered to balance minimalism, clarity, and realism.

Option 1: Single-Page  Website

All content is presented on a single page using clear visual sections, such as:

- Tickets

- Visit logistics

- Exhibition overview

- Artist information

The pros to this

- Minimal navigation

- Shortest possible ticket funnel

- Strong alignment with “reduce friction” goal

Cons

- Less realistic for larger museums

- Requires strong visual hierarchy to avoid overwhelm

Option 2: Task-Based Multi-Page Website, our selected initial approach. Moreover, each page corresponds directly to a user objective:

- Home (overview + primary CTA)

- Tickets

- Plan Your Visit

- Exhibitions

- Artist and Explore

Pros

- Clear mapping between objectives and pages

- Easy to reason about and assess

- Familiar structure for students and users

Cons

- Requires consistent navigation discipline

- Slightly more navigation steps than a single-page design

Option 3: Hybrid Approach. A scroll-based home page for discovery and logistics paired with a dedicated Tickets page.

Pros

- Strong ticket prioritization

- Reduced page hopping

- Realistic compromise

Cons

- Slightly more complex to explain and implement

4. Our current selected implementation from the zip file i provided

So the current implementation follows Option 2 which is the task- based multi-page, as a clear, teachable baseline that helps map one primary objective to each page, maintain consistent navigation across the site, and keeps the “Buy Tickets” call-to-action visible and emphasized on every page. Ultimately, this structure can later be adjusted, such as collapsed into a single-page layout, depending on instructional goals or dataset insights.
