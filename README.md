**67-250 Technology Project — Museum Website Analysis & Redesign: Phase 2 Specification**


In this project, you will move through a real workflow used in analytics and product teams: data → diagnosis → design → implementation

Your job is to use user interaction data to identify a usability problem on a museum website and then build a front-end redesign that directly addresses that problem.

By the end of the project you will submit:

1) Data Analysis Report (Phase 1 outcome)

2) Redesigned Website (Phase 2 outcome)

A working front-end redesign that includes:

- Clear navigation and information structure

- A smoother experience for the task you’re improving (based on Phase 1)

- Responsive layout (desktop + mobile)

- JavaScript interactions

- Embedded media/maps and at least one API feature

Project structure (8 increments)

This project is completed in two phases across eight incremental labs.

Phase 1 — Data Analysis (Database Labs 1–3)

Phase 2 — Solution Design & Implementation (Web Dev Labs 1–5)

- Plan your redesign using wireframes

- Build a multi-page website using HTML

- Improve layout, navigation, and responsiveness with CSS

- Add interactivity using JavaScript + the DOM

- Embed media/maps and integrate at least one API

Goal: Build a redesign that is clearly tied to your Phase 1 findings.

How to think about “success”

This project is not about perfect visuals. A strong submission emphasizes:

- Evidence-based reasoning (your design choices match your data)

- Clarity and usability (pages are organized and easy to navigate)

- Functional correctness (working links, working code, responsive layout)

- A clear connection between “problem in the data” → “solution in the site”


Key folders in this repository:

- views/: all pages except index.html

- static/: CSS, JS, images, and other assets

- wireframes/: your saved wireframes (PNG/PDF or link file)

Important: Your wireframes should be included in the repo (uploaded into wireframes/) so your planning work is documented.
